## Types of AI

AI is a broad term that has evolved overtime. The purpose here is to understand the necessary types of artifacts, constructs, and models that AI provides to make software applications intelligent. Although, this list is long, let's confine te discussion to two broad categories, namely rule-based AI and machine learning.

### Rule-based AI
Rule-based AI is considered a simple technique that tries to represent the domain knowledge and inference rules to draw conclusions. For example, consider the situation where we need to represent the rule "all men are mortal" in a way that it can be used to draw new inferences. It can be represented using the following predicate logic:

- ∀ X man(X) → mortal(X) (read as "for all X, if X is a man, then X is mortal". Here X is a variable)

This rule can be used in combination with domain knoelwedge to draw inferences. For example:

- man(socrates) (read as "socates is a man")

This predicate can be used with the above rule to draw the inference that "socrates is mortal".

The major limitation of this rule-based AI is that it can be used to build deterministic systems only where the data is small and rules are clear. Such systems cannot learn new things themselves.

### Machine learning
Machine learning on the other hand has the capability to define it's own rules based on data. The system can learn and adapt as new data emerges. This capacity to learn and adapt has made machine learning the most popular choice while integrating intelligence is software systems.
