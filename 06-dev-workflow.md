### Development Worflow for AI Systems

This section aims to define a high level process flow to develop a (standalone) AI-based system from scratch. The steps listed are general and may vary from context to context.

1. Problem Definition: As with all, the journey of AI-based systems also begin with problem definition. A few questions are important to identify if AI is the suitable approach for the problem under consideration. For example, why can't the system be implemented using legacy exhaustive algorithmic approaches?, is the system supposed to learn and evolve overtime? Having defined the problem, next step is to determine if AI/ML can be used to address it.
2. Chosing Method: Once the problem is defined and it is decided that it is more viable and suitable to solve it using AI instead of legacy exhaustive methods, the next step is to decide the type of AI to solve the problem. From rule-based AI to different types of ML and deep learning models may be considered and choosen based on the right factors described in the previous section.
3. Data Collection: Having chosen the right methods, the next important steps in most cases is sourcing the data. Data may come from the ongoing processes (which makes this step easier), or may base on designed collection (which is usually challenging). Without the right quality and quantity of data, most AI/ML systems cannot be realized. However, some simpler systems might rely on rule-based AI and may not need data as a primary factor to learn from. Other situations, for example, reinforcement learning may also need less of prior data to start functioning.
4. Data Preprocessing: It is usually required to clean, transform and normalize the data to ensure it is in a suitable format for modeling. Depending on the condition of data, the effort for data preprocessing may vary.
5. Model Selection: Choosing the appropriate AI/ML algorithm for the problem at hand is the next obvious step. While choosing the model, it is important to take into account factors such as the size and type of data, computational resources, and the desired outcome.
6. Model Training: Train the selected model on the preprocessed data using a suitable training algorithm and evaluate its performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.
7. Model Validation: Evaluate the performance of the trained model on a validation set to check for overfitting and make any necessary adjustments.
8. Model Deployment: Deploy the trained model in a suitable environment and make it accessible to users.
9. Monitoring and Maintenance: Continuously monitor the performance of the deployed model and make updates as necessary to ensure it remains accurate and relevant.

These steps can be repeated as needed to improve the model's performance, or to try different algorithms and approaches.
