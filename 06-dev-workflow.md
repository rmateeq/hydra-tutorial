The development workflow of a machine learning system typically involves the following steps:

1. Problem Definition: Identify the problem to be solved and determine if machine learning can be used to address it.
2. Data Collection: Collect the data required to train the model. This can include data from various sources such as databases, APIs, or manual inputs.
3. Data Preprocessing: Clean, transform and normalize the collected data to ensure it is in a suitable format for modeling.
4. Model Selection: Choose the appropriate machine learning algorithm for the problem at hand, taking into account factors such as the size and type of data, computational resources, and the desired outcome.
5. Model Training: Train the selected model on the preprocessed data using a suitable training algorithm and evaluate its performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.
6. Model Validation: Evaluate the performance of the trained model on a validation set to check for overfitting and make any necessary adjustments.
7. Model Deployment: Deploy the trained model in a suitable environment and make it accessible to users.
8. Monitoring and Maintenance: Continuously monitor the performance of the deployed model and make updates as necessary to ensure it remains accurate and relevant.

These steps can be repeated as needed to improve the model's performance, or to try different algorithms and approaches.
