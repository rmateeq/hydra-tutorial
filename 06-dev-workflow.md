### Development Worflow for AI Systems

This section aims to define a high level process flow to develop a (standalone) AI-based system from scratch. The steps listed are general and may vary from context to context.

1. Problem Definition: As with all, the journey of AI-based systems also begin with problem definition. A few questions are important to identify if AI is the suitable approach for the problem under consideration. For example, why can't the system be implemented using legacy exhaustive algorithmic approaches?, is the system supposed to learn and evolve overtime? `Once the need for AI is well understood, the next set of questions arise that tend to define the business objective, target audience, data availability, overall feasibility, and success criteria.` Having defined the problem, next step is to determine if AI/ML can be used to address it.
2. Chosing Method: Once the problem is defined and it is decided that it is more viable and suitable to solve it using AI instead of legacy exhaustive methods, the next step is to decide the type of AI to solve the problem. From rule-based AI to different types of ML and deep learning models may be considered and choosen based on the right factors described in the previous section.
3. Data Collection: Having chosen the right methods, the next important steps in most cases is sourcing the data. Data may come from the ongoing processes (which makes this step easier), or may base on designed collection (which is usually challenging). Without the right quality and quantity of data, most AI/ML systems cannot be realized. However, some simpler systems might rely on rule-based AI and may not need data as a primary factor to learn from. Other situations, for example, reinforcement learning may also need less of prior data to start functioning.
4. Data Preprocessing: It is usually required to clean, transform and normalize the data to ensure it is in a suitable format for modeling. Depending on the condition of data, the effort for data preprocessing may vary.
5. Model Selection: Choosing the appropriate AI/ML algorithm for the problem at hand is the next obvious step. While choosing the model, it is important to take into account factors such as the size and type of data, computational resources, and the desired outcome. It is pertinent to mention that the model selection at this stage is from within the category of method decided during step 2.
6. Model Training and Validation: The chosen model(s) is trained on the preprocessed data and its performance is evaluated using appropriate metrics. A number of different models can be trained to select the most suitable one considering the accuracy and efficiency requirements. During validation, the model undergoes a test as if it is deployed in a real environment. Factors like overfitting are preempted and taken care of at this step.
7. Model Deployment: The system is considered in ready state after the training and validation cycle is completed. However, the journey does not end here. Most often, the trained models are deployed for use as interactive applications on cloud platforms that need relevant skills. Provision of resources and scaling according to the number of users and access frequency is vital in this context.
8. Monitoring and Maintenance: While system is in production, continuous monitoring of the performance of the deployed model and make updates as necessary to ensure it remains accurate and relevant is key to successful system. The data, methods, models may all need fine-tuning and/or replacements overtime as the system evolves.

This is not an exhaustive list of steps to describe the workflow of an AI-based system but presents a high level general view of the course of action along the way.
