In this section, we aim to provide some common use-cases and capabilitites that may interest the businesses, industries, governments, and other stakeholders. Although, we have tried to cover most of the relevant applications, however this list is not exhaustive by any means.

### Use-Case: Supervised Learning

Here is a list of common applications of supervised learning with a brief description of each:
- Fraud detection: The purpose is to use data to identify fradulent transactions or activities. Using supervised learning, model is trained on labeled data to identify fraudulent transactions and detect fraudulent behavior to prevent financial loses.
- Stock price prediction: The aim is to use historical stock price data to predict future stock prices. To achieve this, supervised learning models are trained on historical stock data with a goal to maximize the potential gain by investing in the right stocks.
- Customer churn prediction: The purpose is to identify cutomers why may potentially unsubscribe to the services or products of the business. In this application, a supervised learning model is trained on customer behavior data to predict such customers and take preemptive measure to retain them to maintain business health.
- Healthcare diagnosis: The objective is to diagnose various patient conditions and outcome of medicines and treatmenrs. To accomplish this, supervised learning model is trained on medical data for predictive diagnosis as well as patient outcomes.
- Credit risk analysis: In this application, a supervised learning model is trained on financial data to predict the likelihood of loan defaults and assess credit risk.
- Customer request prioritization: The purpose is to sort and prioritize customer requests based on their importance and urgency. The goal is to ensure that the most important and urgent requests are attended to first, while less important requests are addressed later.

These are just a few examples of the many applications of supervised learning. The choice of a supervised learning algorithm and the specific problem it is used to solve will depend on the nature of the data and the desired outcome.

### Use-Cases: Deep Learning

Image classification: In this application, a supervised learning model is trained on a large dataset of labeled images to identify objects, scenes, or activities in new images.

Speech recognition: In this application, a supervised learning model is trained on labeled speech data to transcribe speech into text and understand spoken commands.

Natural language processing (NLP): In this application, a supervised learning model is trained on labeled text data to perform tasks such as sentiment analysis, text classification, and machine translation.
