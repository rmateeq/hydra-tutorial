In this section, we aim to provide some common use-cases and capabilitites that may interest the businesses, industries, governments, and other stakeholders. Although, we have tried to cover most of the relevant applications, however this list is not exhaustive by any means.

- Image classification: Image calssification is often carried out using large dataset of labeled images to identify objects, scenes, or activities in new images. Different application domains popular for image processing include object detection, face recognision, and medical diagnostics.
- Speech recognition: Machine learning has significantly contributed to the computers ability to recognize human speech. The purpose is to train the models on speech data to transcribe speech into text and understand spoken commands. In addition to transcription, visrtual assistance, automated call handling, voice search, captioning, and language translations are some of the popular application areas for speech recognition.
- Natural language processing (NLP): In this application, a supervised learning model is trained on labeled text data to perform tasks such as sentiment analysis, text classification, and machine translation. The capabilities that NLP brings include sentiment analysis, chatbots, text summarization, named entity recognition, and text classification, etc.
- Environmental monitoring: Protection of environment has become a growing concern overtime. Weather prediction, climate modeling, air and water quality monitoring, wildlife monitoring, forest fire detection, land use monitoring, and hazardous waste monitoring are among the applications that are considered useful.
- Education: Education is no exception when it comes to benefitting from machine learning. Systems like adaptive learning, student performance prediction, educational recommendation systems, grading and assessment, and curriculum design; all have potential to benefit from machine learning.
- Fraud detection: The purpose is to use data to identify fradulent transactions or activities. Using supervised learning, model is trained on labeled data to identify fraudulent transactions and detect fraudulent behavior to prevent financial loses. Some possible types of frauds may involve credir cards, insurance, identity, and healthcare claims, and e-commerce.
- Stock price prediction: The aim is to use historical stock price data to predict future stock prices. To achieve this, supervised learning models are trained on historical stock data with a goal to maximize the potential gain by investing in the right stocks. Stock price prediction may involve analysis of fundamental financial data, and sentiment analysis from news and social media.
- Customer churn prediction: The purpose is to identify cutomers why may potentially unsubscribe to the services or products of the business. In this application, a supervised learning model is trained on customer behavior data to predict such customers and take preemptive measure to retain them to maintain business health. Different approaches relevant for customer churn prediction include recency, frequency, monetary analysis; customer segmentation based on different common factors, and natural lanaguage processing to analyze the text based feedback from customers.
- Healthcare diagnosis: The objective is to diagnose various patient conditions and outcome of medicines and treatmenrs. To accomplish this, supervised learning model is trained on medical data for predictive diagnosis as well as patient outcomes. Machine learning can be used for medical image analysis, learning from electronic health records, personalized medicine, and remote patient monitoring.
- Credit risk analysis: The focus is to minimize the risk of financial credits and thus maximize the potential of recoverability. This is achieved by training supervised learning model on financial data to predict the likelihood of loan defaults before deciding the credit cases. Techniques like application scoring, fraud detection, behavioral scoring, portfolio analysis, and stress testing are common when in comes to credit risk analysis.
- Customer request prioritization: The purpose is to sort and prioritize customer requests based on their importance and urgency. The goal is to ensure that the most important and urgent requests are attended to first, while less important requests are addressed later. Sentiment analysis, contextual analysis, and natural language processing in general are helpful to carry out such tasks. 
- Opportunity flagging: The goal is to automatically flag interactions that are most likely to result in a sale using machine learning algorithms that are trained on labeled data to identify potential sales opportunities in customer interactions. Customer upsell/cross-sell, sales lead scoring, customer retention, and pricing optimization are some of the relevant terms in connection to opportunity flagging.

These are just a few examples of the many capabilities that can be built with AI. The potential for AI is constantly evolving, and new applications and use cases are being discovered all the time.
