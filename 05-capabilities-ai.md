In this section, we aim to provide some common use-cases and capabilitites that may interest the businesses, industries, governments, and other stakeholders. Although, we have tried to cover most of the relevant applications, however this list is not exhaustive by any means.

### Use-Case: Supervised Learning

Here is a list of common applications of supervised learning with a brief description of each:
- Fraud detection: In this application, a supervised learning model is trained on labeled data to identify fraudulent transactions and detect fraudulent behavior.
- Stock price prediction: In this application, a supervised learning model is trained on historical stock price data to predict future stock prices.
- Customer churn prediction: In this application, a supervised learning model is trained on customer behavior data to predict which customers are likely to cancel their services or stop using a product.
- Healthcare diagnosis: In this application, a supervised learning model is trained on medical data to diagnose diseases and predict patient outcomes.
- Credit risk analysis: In this application, a supervised learning model is trained on financial data to predict the likelihood of loan defaults and assess credit risk.

These are just a few examples of the many applications of supervised learning. The choice of a supervised learning algorithm and the specific problem it is used to solve will depend on the nature of the data and the desired outcome.

### Use-Cases: Deep Learning

Image classification: In this application, a supervised learning model is trained on a large dataset of labeled images to identify objects, scenes, or activities in new images.

Speech recognition: In this application, a supervised learning model is trained on labeled speech data to transcribe speech into text and understand spoken commands.

Natural language processing (NLP): In this application, a supervised learning model is trained on labeled text data to perform tasks such as sentiment analysis, text classification, and machine translation.
