### What is AI
AI or artificial intelligence is the way to simulate human intelligence in making the processes intelligent, automated, adaptive, and self-learning. There is endless potential and numerous use case of AI in businesses, healthcare, and city management that have already been identified. However, incoprporating custom applications of AI into existing systems require a lot of effort. In this tutorial, three important questions are addressed:
1. Is there any use case and benefit of AI in my business?
2. What is the effort required to incorporate AI in the existing system?
3. Can there be a way that the adoption of AI become easy and quick?
Before we delve into the detials of how it works, let's understand how AI can be incorporated in the existing systems aiming to improve the efficiency, productivity, responsiveness, and cognition.
Let's begin by addressing the first question.
##### Is there a use case of AI in my business?
It is well-established that numerous businesses are already benefitting fro AI in different ways, and there is a lot of literature detailing those. Let's list of few simple potential use cases of AI in business in a primitive way:
- Add to the customer experience
  - Are you a company receiving or handling customer complaints or request everyday?
    - AI can help prioritize the requests
      - e.g., based on type of text and/or source
    - AI can improve feedback time saving HR costs
      - e.g., by using chatbots to answer primitive queries

In the following diagram, flow of processing of emails in a housing services providing company is illustrated. On a busy day, thousands of emails are recieved by the customer services department, who after carefully reading through each of the email, identifies the relevant department and assigns it a priority. This manual task depends on human resource, space, and time. Forth, it is discusses how AI comes to rescue.

AI is equipped with such models and artifacts that can process the email text to robustly identify the relevant department as well as prioritizes it according to the nature of query. Such models have proven accuracies in carrying out such tasks with margin of errors even less that what humans comit, in general. Moreover, the process is extemely fast and resource saving. The system, often accumulates the emails overtime and also learns from the past data to better adapt and improve the contexual accuracy of the system. This scenario is highlighted in the figure below where the customer services team is almost entirely replaced by an AI-assisted email classification and prioritization system. However, is implementing AI simple enough? This question is addressed next.

- Increase productivity
- Provide insights from data




- Are you the city council receiving volumes of data from the city survellience and monitoring system?
  - AI can help identify the potential hazards and help the concerned departments better prepared
    - e.g., alert rescue service based on weather data
    - e.g., alert rescue service based on incident data
    - e.g., alert enviromental department based on air quality data
    - e.g., alert security agencies based on suspicious activity, face detection
- Are you running air port survellience?
  - e.g., alert security agencies based on suspicious activity, face detection
