### What is AI
AI or artificial intelligence is the way to simulate human intelligence in making the processes intelligent, automated, adaptive, and self-learning. Two important questions that we address in this tutorial are:
1. Is there any use case and benefit of AI in my business?
2. What is the effort required to incorporate AI in the existing system?
Before we delve into the detials of how it works, let's understand how AI can be incorporated in the existing systems aiming to improve the efficiency, productivity, responsiveness, and cognition.
Let's begin by addressing the first question.
