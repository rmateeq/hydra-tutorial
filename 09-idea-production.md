## Putting It All Together: From Idea to Production

In this section, we summarize the steps required to steer an AI/ML project from conception to realization. The essentional set of steps and skills discussed previously are also illustrated in the diagram below. The development workflow for AI and ML involves several essential steps. The first step is to define the problem that needs to be solved, which should be clearly articulated and aligned with the business objectives. The next step is to determine whether traditional programming approaches are adequate for the problem at hand or whether an AI or ML-based solution is necessary.

If an AI or ML-based solution is deemed appropriate, the next step is to identify the type of AI or ML needed, which depends on the problem's nature and the data available. Once the appropriate AI or ML has been selected, data collection must be carried out to gather the relevant data needed to train the model. The diagram uses a dashed arrow leading to the AI and ML pipeline in case the problem is found suitable for reinforcement learning type methods. In such cases, many of the initial steps become context dependent.

The collected data must then be preprocessed to ensure that it is clean and of good quality. This step involves cleaning, filtering, and transforming the data to make it usable for machine learning algorithms. Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is then performed to gain insights into the data and to identify any patterns or trends. Feature engineering follows the EDA step, which involves selecting and extracting the most relevant features from the data to enhance the model's performance. Once the features have been selected, the appropriate model must be chosen for training and validation. This step involves selecting a model architecture and hyperparameters that are best suited for the data and problem at hand.

The model is then trained and validated using a portion of the data. The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Once the model has been validated, it can be deployed into the production environment. After deployment, maintenance activities must be carried out to ensure that the model continues to perform optimally. This step involves monitoring the model's performance, retraining the model as needed, and updating the model to accommodate changes in the data or problem. Regular maintenance is essential to ensure that the model continues to provide accurate and relevant predictions or classifications.
