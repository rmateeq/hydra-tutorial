In the folllowing, some of the mainstream challenges regarding development, deployment, and maintainance of AI based systems are discussed in brief.

1. Sourcing the Data: Unless a purely rule-base system is being designed, most of the current AI-based systems rely on data of some sort. Analyzing sentiments from text, recognizing a face from random walk, flagging a defeted item from production line are only a few of the examples. Sourcing the data, preprocessing it, and finally having the data of sufficient quality that can train the system and generalize the learning for better performance is a major challenge. Poor data leads to poor results. For instance, consider a chest X-ray being used for COVID diagnosis. If we are to train an AI-based system to automatically detect the sysmptoms and severity of the disease, we must have access to sufficient number of varying images in sufficient quality. If either of adequate data or good data is missing, achieving a practically reliable system is virtually impossible.
2. Choosing the Right Methods: Alongside data, come the methods applied on data to achieve sufficient accuracy. Because AI-based algorithms are neither exhaustive nor optimal, choosing the right ind of methods is another big challenge. The number of methods available and their suitability to different kind of data and problems requires expert insights, empirical results, and the right intuition. Where decision tree based methd might do very well for structured data, they cannot handle the complexity offered by images, audios, and videos. In choosing the right methods, performance or accuracy is not the only concern. Efficiency can become a bottleneck with some methods like deep neural networks. Therefore, choice of the right method is often a tradeoff between accuracy and efficiency.
