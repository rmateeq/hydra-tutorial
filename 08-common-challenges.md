## Common Challenges Related to AI Systems

In the following, some of the mainstream challenges regarding the development, deployment, and maintenance of AI-based systems are discussed in brief.

1. Sourcing the Data: Unless a purely rule-based system is being designed, most of the current AI-based systems rely on data of some sort. Analyzing sentiments from text, recognizing a face from a random walk, and flagging a defective item from the production line are only a few examples. Sourcing the data, preprocessing it, and finally having the data of sufficient quality that can train the system and generalize the learning for better performance is a major challenge. Poor data leads to poor results. For instance, consider a chest X-ray is used for COVID diagnosis. If we are to train an AI-based system to automatically detect the symptoms and severity of the disease, we must have access to a sufficient number of varying images in sufficient quality. If either adequate data or good data are missing, achieving a practically reliable system is virtually impossible.
2. Choosing the Right Methods: Alongside data, come the methods applied to data to achieve sufficient accuracy. Because AI-based algorithms are neither exhaustive nor optimal, choosing the right kind of methods is another big challenge. The number of methods available and their suitability to different kinds of data and problems require expert insights, empirical results, and the right intuition. Where the decision tree-based method might do very well for structured data, it cannot handle the complexity offered by images, audio, and videos. In choosing the right methods, performance or accuracy is not the only concern. Efficiency can become a bottleneck with some methods like deep neural networks. Therefore, the choice of the right method is often a tradeoff between accuracy and efficiency.
3. Steering the System from Training to Production: The model training and deployment remain coupled as the system evolves. Ensuring model performance on new, unseen can be difficult. Other issues may include managing model complexity, addressing data drift (over time, the distribution of the data may change, requiring the model to be retrained and redeployed), ethical and legal concerns, scaling and serving the model, etc.
4. Lack of Expertise and Resources: Lack of expertise and resources can be major challenges in implementing and maintaining machine learning systems. These challenges may arise in the form of a lack of skilled professionals, complexity of the technology, high computational costs, data quality and preparation, and integration with existing systems

To overcome these challenges, stakeholders may need to carefully plan and prepare, work with experienced professionals, and continuously monitor and evaluate their systems to ensure they are operating effectively.
