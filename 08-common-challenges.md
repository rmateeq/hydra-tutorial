In the folllowing, some of the mainstream challenges regarding development, deployment, and maintainance of AI based systems are discussed in brief.

1. Sourcing the Data: Unless a purely rule-base system is being designed, most of the current AI-based systems rely on data of some sort. Analyzing sentiments from text, recognizing a face from random walk, flagging a defeted item from production line are only a few of the examples. Sourcing the data, preprocessing it, and finally having the data of sufficient quality that can train the system and generalize the learning for better performance is a major challenge. Poor data leads to poor results. For instance, consider a chest X-ray being used for COVID diagnosis. If we are to train an AI-based system to automatically detect the sysmptoms and severity of the disease, we must have access to sufficient number of varying images in sufficient quality. If either of adequate data or good data is missing, achieving a practically reliable system is virtually impossible.
2. Choosing the Right Methods: Alongside data, come the methods applied on data to achieve sufficient accuracy. Because AI-based algorithms are neither exhaustive nor optimal, choosing the right ind of methods is another big challenge. The number of methods available and their suitability to different kind of data and problems requires expert insights, empirical results, and the right intuition. Where decision tree based methd might do very well for structured data, they cannot handle the complexity offered by images, audios, and videos. In choosing the right methods, performance or accuracy is not the only concern. Efficiency can become a bottleneck with some methods like deep neural networks. Therefore, choice of the right method is often a tradeoff between accuracy and efficiency.
3. Steering the System from Training to Production: The challenges of deploying a machine learning model in production include:

Ensuring model performance: The model should perform well on new, unseen data in a production environment.
Managing model complexity: As models become more complex, they can be difficult to deploy and maintain in production.
Addressing data drift: Over time, the distribution of the data may change, requiring the model to be retrained and redeployed.
Addressing ethical and legal concerns: ML models can have unintended consequences, such as discrimination, so it's important to consider these implications before deployment.
Integration with existing systems: ML models need to be integrated with the rest of an organization's systems and processes.
Scaling and serving the model: As the number of users or requests increases, the model needs to be able to handle the increased load.
Monitoring and maintenance: Regular monitoring is necessary to ensure the model continues to perform well and to address any issues that arise.
4. Monitoring Data in Production: Monitoring machine learning models in production is important for several reasons:

Model performance degradation: Over time, the distribution of the data that the model encounters in production may change, leading to a degradation in its performance. Monitoring allows you to detect and address this issue.

Model bias: Monitoring helps detect and prevent any unintended biases in the model's predictions.

Model interpretability: Monitoring allows you to understand the model's behavior and make informed decisions about its future deployment.

Compliance and regulatory requirements: Some industries have strict regulations regarding the use of machine learning models, and monitoring helps ensure that the models are in compliance with these regulations.

Model accountability: Monitoring provides transparency into how the model is making decisions, which is important for building trust with stakeholders and ensuring that the model is being used ethically.

Therefore, monitoring is critical to ensure that the models continue to operate effectively and safely in production.
5. Lack of Expertise and Resources: Lack of expertise and resources can be major challenges in implementing and maintaining machine learning systems. These challenges include:

Lack of skilled professionals: Machine learning is a specialized field and there is a shortage of professionals with the skills and expertise required to design, build, and maintain machine learning systems.

Complexity of the technology: Machine learning algorithms and systems can be complex and difficult to understand, even for experienced professionals.

High computational cost: Machine learning algorithms require a significant amount of computing resources, which can be expensive and pose a challenge for organizations with limited budgets.

Data quality and preparation: Machine learning algorithms are only as good as the data they are trained on. Ensuring that the data is accurate, complete, and relevant can be a challenge, especially for organizations with large and complex datasets.

Integration with existing systems: Integrating machine learning systems with existing business processes and systems can be challenging and requires expertise in both machine learning and IT.

To overcome these challenges, organizations may need to invest in training and development programs for their employees, work with external experts and consulting firms, and allocate adequate resources for data preparation and model deployment.

Designing and implementing machine learning systems can be challenging due to several factors, including:

Data quality and preparation: Machine learning algorithms are only as good as the data they are trained on. Ensuring that the data is accurate, complete, and relevant can be a challenge, especially for organizations with large and complex datasets.

Model selection: There are many different machine learning algorithms to choose from, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. Selecting the right algorithm for a specific problem can be challenging and requires a deep understanding of the problem and the data.

Overfitting: Overfitting occurs when a model is too complex and memorizes the training data, but fails to generalize to new data. Preventing overfitting requires a trade-off between model complexity and performance.

Bias and fairness: Machine learning models can introduce biases into their predictions, which can have negative consequences, especially in applications where decisions made by the model can have a significant impact on individuals or groups.

Explainability and interpretability: Many machine learning models are complex and opaque, making it difficult to understand how they make predictions. This can be a challenge in applications where transparency and accountability are important.

Integration with existing systems: Integrating machine learning systems with existing business processes and systems can be challenging and requires expertise in both machine learning and IT.

Scalability: Machine learning systems can be computationally intensive, requiring significant computing resources and making it challenging to scale the systems to handle large and growing datasets.

To overcome these challenges, organizations may need to invest in careful planning and preparation, work with experienced machine learning professionals, and continuously monitor and evaluate their systems to ensure they are operating effectively.
