## How are building A.I. capabilities different?

Computer programming has been around for over a century now. As the emergence of new and richer programming languages is witnessed, software engineering practices have also been maturing. From machine and assembly to C/C++, and then languages like Java, C#, and Python took expressibility and abstraction to next levels. The paradigms kept emerging as the software world witnesses a shift from procedural to other paradigms like object-oriented and functional. On the other hand, software development life cycle begining with simple sequential style, now stands at adoption of agile and devops practices.

Isn't it enough to enable incorporation of AI into the modern day software? Well, not really! Because the purpose of computer programming has primarily been to produce specific software with very deterministic behavior mimicing the logic given to it. It does not aim to integrate any generic behavior, adaptation or self-learning which is the aim of AI. In a nutshell, the purpose of AI is to enable computers to learn to adapt as the new situations emerge based on their experience rather than waiting for the programmer to do explicit modifications.

Is it possible? Well, one example of a problem that can be solved with AI but not with legacy programming is speech recognition. Legacy programming techniques typically involve writing a set of rules that determine how the system should interpret incoming audio signals and convert them into text. However, these rules can be complex and difficult to maintain, and they may not be able to handle the wide range of accents, dialects, and speaking styles that exist in the real world. In contrast, AI techniques can be used to train a system to recognize speech patterns without relying on explicit rules. By analyzing large amounts of audio data and identifying patterns in the data, the system can learn to recognize different speech sounds and map them to corresponding text.

This approach has proven highly effective in applications such as virtual assistants, speech-to-text transcription, and automated call centers. By using AI techniques, these systems can achieve high levels of accuracy even in noisy or challenging environments, and they can adapt to new speech patterns and languages with minimal human intervention.

The jounery to use AI in designing applications and solving real-life problems that are otherwise challenging or even impossible, is ongoing and significant milestones have been achieved already. Let's shift the focus on different types of capabilities that AI can help build, and conventional programming and software engineering cannot.
