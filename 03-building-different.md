## How are building A.I. capabilities different?

Computer programming has been around for over a century now. As the emergence of new and richer programming languages is witnessed, software engineering practices have also been maturing. From machine and assembly to C/C++, and then languages like Java, C#, and Python took expressibility and abstraction to next levels. The paradigms kept emerging as the software world witnesses a shift from procedural to paradigms like object oriented and functional. On the other hand, software development life cycle begining with simple sequential style, now stands at adoption of agile and devops practices.

Isn't it enough to enable incorporation of AI into the modern day software? Well, not really! Because the purpose of computer programming has primarily been to produce specific software with very deterministic behavior mimicing the logic given to it. It does not aim to integrate any generic behavior, adaptation or self-learning which is the aim of AI. In a nutshell, the purpose of AI is to enable computers to learn to adapt as the new situations emerge based on their experience rather than waiting for the programmer to do explicit modification.

Is it possible? Yes, the jounery is ongoing and significant milestones have been achieved already. Let's shift the focus on different types of capabilities that AI can help build, and conventional programming and software engineering cannot.
