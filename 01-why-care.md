## Why should developers and product teams care about AI?
AI, refered to as the **new electricity**, is at the realistic verge of transofrming the world. Businesses, governments, healthcare, transportation, agriculture, media, virtually every sector has a huge potential to harness AI for self-learning, adaptive, and eveloving processes and designs.

In the follwoing, usecases from various application domains are presented to further clear the perspective:

### Usecase1
Imagine a customer filling a support ticket for a complaint or service request, etc. Using the power of AI, the software system can recommend the releavnt articles/tutorials to potentially save the time of cutomer as well as service provider. The figure below depicts a scenario where a customer wants to know about the best use of credit card points they have accumulated overtime. As they type in the question, the AI power system does it's best to recommend the most appropriate articles available in the repository. Better AI can significantly improve the chances of findinf the right match, if there.

### Usecase2
Think of a community website that aims to filter or flag the inappropriate posts/comments. AI can come to recue by doing it's best to identify and classify the content according to the given criteria. The figure below illustrates a scenario where a community website filters the posts/comments intending the personal promotions of somekind and allows the appropriate ones only. This involves delicate text processing that requires the AI power.

### Usecase3
Envision the framework of a social media management platform integrating multiple social media profiles of an individual or a company. In addition to the basic options available on a particular social media platforms, this integration adds several new dimentions of choices increasing the complexity. AI can learn the most used and appropriate actions overtime and can adapt naturally. An example is describes in the figure below where an AI powered system recommends the most appropriate options/actions for a user in the context.
