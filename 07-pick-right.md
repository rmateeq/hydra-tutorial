## Picking the Right AI

Many factors can play an important role when choosing the right type of AI for the system under consideration. In the following, some vital factors are listed that should guide the choice of the right type of AI.

1. Type of Problem: this is usually the first factor in deciding the right type of AI. The suitability of techniques varies from problem to problem. For example, a simple home automation system may rely on rule-based AI where simple rules like light intensity can trigger the lights ON/OFF operations. For delicate diagnoses based on medical imaging, the classification may be a suitable approach. For identifying people with similar interests, clustering from unsupervised learning may help. For better energy management, an agent may turn ON/OFF appliances based on their energy profiles using reinforcement learning.
2. Data Availability: Not all but most of today's AI systems depend on data of some kind. Some AI techniques are more data-intensive and require large amounts of high-quality data to be effective. Both supervised and unsupervised learning requires data whereas supervised learning also needs to be aware of correct answers or outcomes for training. Stock market predictions, fraud detection, predictive maintenance in manufacturing and transportation, supply chain optimizations, and many healthcare-related systems heavily rely on the availability of quality data in adequate quantity.
3. Computational Resources: Computational resources available for training and running the model can be crucial in deciding the type of AI chosen. Some AI techniques require significant processing power and memory, while others may be computationally economical. Deep learning (widely used for problems related to unstructured data like images, audio/video), reinforcement learning (used in game playing, ad-hoc routing, self-driving cars), monte carlo tree search (used in robotics, reinforcement learning applications), and natural language processing are some examples of computationally expensive techniques and application domains. Whereas, decision trees (used in customer segmentation, and credit risk analysis), Naive Bayes (used for text classification and spam filtering), and linear regression (used in stock price prediction, energy consumption, and real estate analysis) are not just effective in their respective domains but also efficient in using computational resources.
4. Model Accuracy: Accuracy requirements also vary from system to system. Some AI techniques may turn out more accurate than others, but may also require more resources and time to train. Systems with real-time requirements that may cause catastrophic effects or may lead to security threats may exhibit a low tolerance for inaccurate predictions. Deciding on the level of accuracy is an important factor in the choice of the right AI techniques for the system.
5. Time Constraints: Time constraints may well get listed as a tradeoff with model accuracy. More often, accuracy is in an inverse proportion to time. Some AI techniques are quicker to train and deploy, while others may require more time to achieve the desired level of accuracy.
6. Explainability: Some AI techniques, such as decision trees, are more interpretable, while others, such as deep neural networks, can be more complex and less transparent. The systems that require some kind of audit in explaining the line of reasoning followed (e.g., medical diagnostic system) may opt to use more explainable methods, while other systems that may deal with more complex data (e.g., images) may opt for more accuracy at the expense of explainability by opting models like deep neural networks.
7. Deployment Environment: Various factors, such as the need for real-time performance or the ability to work offline can be decisive in the choice of type of AI. Some AI techniques are better suited for specific deployment environments than others. Deployment of complex models such as deep neural networks, real-time requirements, and explainability may make it hard to deploy a model with limited resources. Other models, such as linear regression, decision trees, and rule-based techniques are less resource hungry and considered easy to deploy. There have been breakthroughs in the form of pre-trained models and transfer learning that makes it easy to handle deployment complexity in demanding situations.

These are some of the key factors that should be considered when choosing the right type of AI for system development. It is important to carefully evaluate each of these factors and to weigh the trade-offs between different AI techniques to select the one that is most appropriate for the given problem and requirements.
